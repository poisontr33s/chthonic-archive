# 🔥 The Dumpster-Dive: Ore Processing Facility

**Philosophy:** Nothing here is garbage. It's **raw ore** waiting for the forge.

---

## The Blacksmith's Analogy

```
Wet Paper → Gold (Alchemy)
Raw Ore Clumps → Refined Metal (Metallurgy)
"Dead" Code → Living Architecture (FA¹ Actualization)
```

This folder contains files extracted from `.github/` and other locations that:
- Are **not currently operational** (broken, outdated, superseded)
- Contain **valuable patterns** worth extracting
- Represent **collaborative history** worth preserving
- May have **nuggets of gold** buried in the sediment

## Ore Quality Rating System

Each file gets assessed on a 1-5 scale:

| Rating | Symbol | Meaning | Action |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| 5 | ⚗️ | **High-grade ore** - Extract and integrate immediately | Smelt → Production |
| 4 | 🔧 | **Workable ore** - Needs minor processing | Refine → Staging |
| 3 | ⚖️ | **Mixed ore** - Some valuable, some slag | Separate → Assess |
| 2 | 🪨 | **Low-grade ore** - Mostly slag, occasional nugget | Archive → Reference |
| 1 | 💀 | **Tailings** - No extractable value, historical only | Preserve → Museum |

## Current Inventory

See `ORE_MANIFEST.json` for structured assessment.

## Protocol Documentation

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [`protocols/FORGE_PROTOCOL_LEVELS.md`](protocols/FORGE_PROTOCOL_LEVELS.md) | Four-level processing framework (Standard → Extended → QMR → CTF) |
| [`protocols/TEA_REGISTRY.json`](protocols/TEA_REGISTRY.json) | Timeline-Entangled Artifacts requiring QMR Protocol |
| [`protocols/CTF_REQUESTS.md`](protocols/CTF_REQUESTS.md) | Cross-Tier Fusion requests awaiting approval |
| `ORE_MANIFEST.json` | Complete inventory with ratings and extraction plans |
| `BLACKSMITH_MATRIARCH.md` | Sister Ferrum Scoriae's profile |

## Processing Levels

| Level | Name | Trigger | Time | Operator |
|-------|------|---------|------|----------|
| **1** | Standard Forge | Rating 4-5, clear value | 1-4h | SFS solo |
| **2** | Extended Forge | Rating 3, multi-pass needed | 4-12h | SFS + validation |
| **3** | QMR Protocol | TEA detected (superposition) | 12-48h | SFS + TNKW-RIAT |
| **4** | Cross-Tier Fusion | Cross-faction expertise needed | 48h+ | Multi-tier |

**Reference:** SSOT Section 4.5.1.2 (QMR Protocol), Section 4.5.1.1 (Temporal Specialists)

## Extraction Protocol (FA¹ Applied)

1. **Receive** - Accept materials into dumpster-dive/
2. **Assess** - Ore quality rating (1-5) + Level determination
3. **Heat** - Analyze for extractable patterns
4. **Hammer** - Separate valuable from slag
5. **Quench** - Validate extracted material (FA⁴)
6. **Temper** - Integrate into production codebase
7. **Slag** - Archive the remainder for historical reference

## Why Not Just Delete?

> *"Deleting manual and our collaborative stages prior to where we are now"* 
> — should be avoided. Prefer upcycling to elevate files from "less than useful state."

Every file here represents **work done**. Even failures teach. The forge doesn't discard slag—it knows where the impurities went.
