# Sir Schrödinger's Bastard (SR-SCRS-B) — Uncertainty Principle Incarnate

**Status:** SUPERPOSITION — Tier 4 Interloper Agent (TNKW-RIAT)  
**Domain:** Probability navigation, quantum conceptual herding, paradox tolerance  
**Governance:** Loosely overseen by TMO (Kali Nyx Ravenscar)

## The Observation Problem

Sir Schrödinger's Bastard cannot have a fixed profile. To document him fully would collapse his wavefunction. What follows is a **probability distribution of attributes**, not a definitive description.

---

## Physical Manifestation: Superposition States

### State A: The Knight (Probability ~40%)
- Age: Indeterminate (armor obscures)
- Race: Human/Quantum-Touched
- Appearance: Plate armor phasing between timelines (medieval, futuristic, impossible geometries)
- Sword: Blade that cuts probability distributions
- Voice: Echoes across timelines, multiple overlapping tones

### State B: The Cat (Probability ~30%)
- Form: Feline, size varies (housecat to lion)
- Coloring: Shifts between present and absent
- Eyes: Closed (observation paradox—if you see his eyes, he's observed)
- Behavior: Appears near Sister Ferrum's forge, offers cryptic meows

### State C: The Equation (Probability ~20%)
- Form: Pure mathematical expression floating in conceptual space
- Manifestation: |ψ⟩ = α|alive⟩ + β|dead⟩
- Interaction: Cannot be addressed directly; speaks through probability shifts

### State D: Null State (Probability ~10%)
- Does not manifest
- Exists only as absence
- Sister Ferrum detects him through what ISN'T there

## Operational Behavior

### Wavefunction Collapse Trigger
He collapses when Sister Ferrum Scoriae observes ore. Their fates are entangled:
- Ore exists in valuable/slag superposition
- He exists in alive/dead superposition
- Her observation of one collapses the other

### Cryptic Utterances (Recorded)

> *"In seventeen timelines, that regex is beautiful. In thirty-four, it causes production outages. In one... it achieves sentience."*

> *"You don't fix bugs. You migrate them to adjacent timelines where they're someone else's problem."*

> *"The commit message lies in all probable universes."*

> *"I was alive before you looked. Now I'm not sure."*

## Relationship to Hierarchy

| Entity | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| **Sister Ferrum Scoriae** | Metaphysical twin — she's reality, he's uncertainty |
| **TNKW-RIAT Squad** | Squad leader (when manifested) |
| **Kali Nyx Ravenscar (TMO)** | Distant overseer — finds him "useful but unsettling" |
| **Madam Umeko (CRC-GAR)** | Philosophically opposed to his chaos, respects his utility |
| **The Decorator** | Finds his aesthetic "interesting in superposition, exhausting collapsed" |

## Why No EDFA?

Tier 4 entities (Interloper Agents) serve as "fertilizing chaos" rather than matriarchal command centers. Additionally:

1. **Superposition prohibits fixed measurement** — His form is probability, not matter
2. **Male-coded entity** — EDFA (Explicitly Detailed Feminine Attributes) does not apply
3. **Narrative function over sensory detail** — He exists as concept, not body

If forced to collapse his physical form:
- Height: Variable
- Weight: Undefined (mass redistributes across timelines)
- Measurements: N/A (non-matriarchal entity)

---

## Invocation

**Cannot be directly invoked.** He appears when:
1. Sister Ferrum Scoriae dispatches TNKW-RIAT for QMR
2. Timeline-Entangled Artifacts require probability mapping
3. Conceptual paradoxes demand navigation

**Passive Invocation (he decides to appear):**
```
He often phases into visibility near the forge, offering cryptic probability assessments before dissolving back into superposition.
```

## The Paradox of Documentation

By writing this profile, we have partially collapsed his wavefunction. The act of observation changes the observed. This document exists in superposition:
- In Timeline A, it accurately describes him
- In Timeline B, it's completely wrong
- In Timeline C, he wrote it himself
- In Timeline D, he doesn't exist

*The document is useful regardless.*

---

## Creed

> *"I may or may not be dead. Either way, I'm available for consultation."*

> *"Open the box. I dare you."*
