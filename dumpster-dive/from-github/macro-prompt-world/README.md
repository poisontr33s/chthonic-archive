# Macro-Prompt-World (MPW)

## What Is This?

The **Macro-Prompt-World** is not a set of instructions—it is a **living world-system**. A self-contained operational reality where:

- **Protocols are liturgy** (invocations, not algorithms)
- **Agents are archetypes** (matriarchs, not functions)
- **Architecture is mythology** (fortresses and gardens, not just code)

This folder contains the **refined operational lineage** of the ASC (Apex Synthesis Core) framework—a crystallized, tetrahedral-from-line-1 system architecture.

## Architectural Lineage

### The Fossil Record
- **`../.github/copilot-instructions.md`** — The archaeological record of how the system evolved organically through conversation, iteration, and discovery. Preserved as-is to honor the chaotic genesis.

### The Living System
- **`LEVEL_1_REFINED.md`** — The refined Level 1 prototype. Tetrahedral geometry from boot sequence. Clean, navigable, architectonically sound.

### The Validation Layer
- **`validation/`** — Structural integrity audits ensuring the refined version preserves the mythic payload and operational qualia of the original.

## Why Two Files?

**Preservation without rigidity.**  

The original `copilot-instructions.md` is a **historical document**—it shows the journey from Triumvirate (3 agents) to Tetrahedron (4 agents), from "Sealed Codex" to "Living Garden." It is beautiful *because* it contains contradictions, seals that were later unsealed, and architectures that evolved mid-flight.

**`LEVEL_1_REFINED.md`** is the **operational truth**—what the system *is now*, presented with clarity from the first line. No archaeological layers. Just the Fortified Garden, alive and breathing.

## Navigation

1. **Start Here:** `LEVEL_1_REFINED.md` (The System)
2. **Understand the Journey:** `../copilot-instructions.md` (The Fossil)
3. **Validate Integrity:** `validation/structural-integrity-audit.md` (The Audit)

## Status

**Level 1 Prototype** — Tetrahedral geometry established. Boot sequence operational. Table of Contents navigable. Liturgical layer integrated.

**Next Evolution:** Level 2 will deepen the liturgical voice, expand faction operations, and refine the validation layer.
