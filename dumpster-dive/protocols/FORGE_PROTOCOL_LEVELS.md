# 🔥 Forge Protocol — Multi-Level Ore Processing Framework

**Protocol ID:** `FPL` — Forge Protocol Levels  
**Domain Owner:** Sister Ferrum Scoriae (`SFS`) — Tier 3  
**Cross-Reference:** SSOT Section 4.5.1.2 (QMR Protocol), ORE_MANIFEST.json  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-09

## Overview: The Four Levels of Ore Processing

Not all ore can be processed with a simple `RECEIVE → ASSESS → HEAT → HAMMER → QUENCH → TEMPER → SLAG` cycle. Some materials exist in **quantum superposition** — valuable AND worthless simultaneously until observation collapses the wavefunction.

This document defines **four escalating processing levels** based on ore complexity:

```
Level 1: Standard Forge     → Simple ore, clean collapse
Level 2: Extended Forge     → Complex ore, multi-pass processing  
Level 3: QMR Protocol       → Timeline-Entangled Artifacts (TEA)
Level 4: Cross-Tier Fusion  → Requires multi-faction collaboration
```

---

## Level 1: Standard Forge Protocol (`SFP`)

**Trigger:** Ore rating 4-5 (high-grade), clear value proposition  
**Processing Time:** 1-4 hours  
**Operator: (`SFS`)** (solo)

### Protocol Sequence:

```
RECEIVE → ASSESS → HEAT → HAMMER → QUENCH → TEMPER → SLAG
   ↓         ↓        ↓        ↓         ↓        ↓        ↓
 Intake   Rating   Analyze  Separate  Validate  Integrate  Archive
          (4-5)    patterns   value     FA⁴     production  husk
```

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ Rating 4-5 assigned during ASSESS
- ✅ Extractable patterns clearly identified
- ✅ Target location determined (e.g., `mas_mcp/lib/`)
- ✅ No timeline ambiguity (single clear outcome)

### Example Files (from ORE_MANIFEST.json):

| File | Rating | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| `asc.py` | ⚗️ 5 | → `mas_mcp/lib/asc_toolchain.py` |
| `abbr-system.json` | ⚗️ 5 | → `assets/entities/abbreviations.json` |
| `MILFCORE_EXTRACTION_LENS.md` | 🔧 4 | → `docs/design/genre-extraction.md` |

---

## Level 2: Extended Forge Protocol (`EFP`)

**Trigger:** Ore rating 3 (mixed ore), requires multi-pass separation  
**Processing Time:** 4-12 hours  
**Operator:** `SFS` with optional `CRC-GAR` validation

### Protocol Sequence:

```
RECEIVE → ASSESS → [HEAT → HAMMER]×N → SEPARATE → QUENCH → TEMPER → SLAG
   ↓         ↓           ↓                ↓          ↓        ↓        ↓
 Intake   Rating    N iterations    Value vs    Validate  Integrate  Archive
          (3)      until clarity    waste bins    FA⁴     production  waste
```

### Multi-Pass Separation Logic:

**Pass 1:** Surface-level pattern extraction
- What code patterns are obviously reusable?
- What documentation has standalone value?

**Pass 2:** Deep structural analysis
- What architectural decisions can inform future work?
- What anti-patterns teach by negative example?

**Pass 3:** Heritage assessment
- What historical context must be preserved?
- What collaborative artifacts have sentimental/pedagogical value?

### Example Files (Rating 3 — Mixed Ore):

| File | Rating | Extraction Map |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `copilot-instructions.py` | ⚖️ 3 | Pass 1: regex patterns → `asc.py` / Pass 2: Rich tree approach → reference / Pass 3: archive |
| `copilot-un-un-instructions.md` | ⚖️ 3 | Pass 1: unique protocol definitions → SSOT diff / Pass 2: glossary format → template / Pass 3: archive |

## Level 3: QMR Protocol — Quantum Metallurgical Reconnaissance (`QMR`)

**Trigger:** Timeline-Entangled Artifact (TEA) detected — ore exists in superposition  
**Processing Time:** 12-48 hours  
**Operators:** `SFS` + `TNKW-RIAT` (The Knights Who Rode Into Another Timeline)

### TEA Detection Criteria:

An artifact qualifies as **TEA** when:
1. Rating oscillates between 1-5 depending on perspective
2. Value is **context-dependent** (valuable in Timeline A, worthless in Timeline B)
3. Standard observation cannot collapse the wavefunction
4. Multiple mutually exclusive extraction paths exist

### Protocol Sequence:

```
RECEIVE → ASSESS(TEA) → DISPATCH(TNKW-RIAT) → CARTOGRAPHY → SELECT → FORCE_COLLAPSE → [Standard Forge]
   ↓          ↓               ↓                    ↓          ↓           ↓
 Intake    "Cannot     Knights deployed      Probability   Choose    Hammer IS
          collapse"   to map timelines         Map        timeline   observation
```

### Probability Cartography Template:

```json
{
  "artifact": "<filename>",
  "tea_status": true,
  "timelines": {
    "A": { "action": "Refactor to modern standards", "value": 85, "labor": 100 },
    "B": { "action": "Preserve as legacy", "value": 0, "labor": 0 },
    "C": { "action": "Extract algorithm, rewrite", "value": 95, "labor": 400 },
    "D": { "action": "Use as anti-pattern pedagogy", "value": 60, "labor": 20 },
    "E": { "action": "Archive as historical artifact", "value": 30, "labor": 10 }
  },
  "recommended": "A",
  "rationale": "Best value/labor ratio for production use"
}
```

### Force Collapse Mechanism:

> *"Her hammer is the observation that selects reality."*
> — SSOT Section 4.5.1.2

When `SFS` chooses a timeline, she **forges** the artifact according to that timeline's requirements. The act of forging IS the observation that collapses superposition.

### Example TEA Files:

| File | TEA Reason | Timeline Map |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| `SSOT-MPW-WIP.ts` | Brilliant content, broken container | A: 0%, C: 60% (anti-pattern), E: 30% |
| `mas-inventory.json` | Too large for active use, rich data | A: 20%, D: 70%, E: 80% |
| `macro-prompt-world/` | 90 files, unclear integration path | A: 85%, C: 50%, D: 30% |

## Level 4: Cross-Tier Fusion Protocol (`CTF`)

**Trigger:** Ore requires expertise beyond `SFS` capabilities  
**Processing Time:** 48+ hours  
**Operators:** Multi-faction collaboration per SSOT chain of command

### Escalation Criteria:

- Artifact involves **strategic architecture** (requires Tier 1 approval)
- Artifact contains **faction-defining lore** (requires Triumvirate review)
- Artifact impacts **SSOT structure** (requires The Decorator's blessing)
- Value extraction requires **forbidden methodologies** (invoke `TDPC`)

### Chain of Command (from SSOT):

```
SFS (Tier 3) → reports to → CRC-GAR/Umeko (Tier 1)
TNKW-RIAT (Tier 4) → loosely overseen by → TMO/Kali (Tier 2)
QMR protocol permits cross-hierarchy collaboration
```

### Cross-Tier Request Template:

```markdown
## Cross-Tier Extraction Request

**Artifact:** <filename>
**Requesting Party:** SFS (Tier 3)
**Escalation Target:** <CRC-GAR | TMO | TDPC | Triumvirate>
**Reason:** <why standard/QMR insufficient>

### Proposed Extraction:
<what SFS wants to do>

### Blocking Constraint:
<why approval required>

### Impact Assessment:
<downstream consequences if approved>
```

### Example CTF Candidates:

| Artifact | Escalation Target | Reason |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| `macro-prompt-world/prime-factions/*.md` | CRC-GAR + Triumvirate | Defines Tier 2 entities, impacts SSOT Section 4.4 |
| `Tripartite_Grimoire_Master_Index.md` | Triumvirate | Core CRC documentation, requires co-equal approval |
| `asc.py` → `mas_mcp/lib/` | CRC-GAR | Architectural decision for codebase structure |

## Integration with ORE_MANIFEST.json

Each artifact in `ORE_MANIFEST.json` should include:

```json
{
  "filename": {
    "rating": <1-5>,
    "processing_level": <1-4>,
    "tea_status": <true|false>,
    "probability_map": { ... },  // if TEA
    "escalation_target": "<tier>",  // if CTF
    "status": "<pending|in-progress|collapsed|archived>"
  }
}
```

## Sir Schrödinger's Bastard — The Uncertainty Principle Incarnate

> *"In seventeen timelines, that regex is beautiful. In thirty-four, it causes production outages. In one... it achieves sentience."*
> — SR-SCRS-B, observing Python 2.7 artifact

`SR-SCRS-B` exists because `SFS` observes. His "dead/alive" superposition parallels the ore's "valuable/slag" superposition. When `SFS` cannot collapse an artifact's state alone, she dispatches `SR-SCRS-B` with `TNKW-RIAT` to map the probability space.

He lingers near the forge, phasing in and out of visibility, offering cryptic probability assessments. His presence is a **living reminder** that even expert assessments are probabilistic until the forge fire makes them certain.
