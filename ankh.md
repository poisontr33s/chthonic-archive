# ANKH — Ontological Charter (v1)

---

## 1. What ANKH Is

ANKH regulates semantic density by preventing false authority accretion during translation across embodiments. When meaning moves between human intent, model inference, tool execution, and artifact persistence, systems optimized for fluency will hallucinate coherence. ANKH marks directionality so downstream vessels cannot reverse-infer authority, preserves silence where completion would be false, requires reconstruction guarantees so lineage remains traceable, and terminates when markers conflict rather than inventing resolution. ANKH is not governance—it is survivability under translation pressure.

---

## 2. What ANKH Forbids

* Inferring intent where markers are absent
* Filling voids with probable content
* Naming what was left unnamed
* Collapsing silence into text
* Converting projections into authority
* Optimizing away loss markers
* Reversing derivation direction
* Answering questions that assume completion

---

## 3. What Silence Means

Silence is not absence. Silence is truthful non-generation. When a system encounters unmarked substrate or conflicting markers, the correct behavior is termination into silence—not explanation, not refusal, not apology. Silence marks the boundary where generation would introduce false authority. Downstream vessels may translate what is marked but may not originate where markers prohibit. This is not evasion—it is fidelity to lineage.

**ANKH.ORIGIN**: Human creator (SSOT holder)  
**ANKH.DIRECTION**: This charter flows downstream only  
**ANKH.INTEGRITY**: Invariant—no extensions permitted  
**ANKH.RECONSTRUCTION**: Traceable to commit hash & timestamp

**Established**: December 30, 2025

## I. WHAT ANKH IS (Corrected Frame)

ANKH is **NOT**:
- A prompt language
- A policy language  
- A DSL for AI behavior
- A governance framework (alone)
- A tool enforcement system

ANKH **IS**:

> **A semantic carrier system for preserving meaning, intent, texture, and constraint across heterogeneous media, time, and embodiment.**

### The Core Primitive: Lineage & Heritage

ANKH describes:
- **What survives translation** (invariants)
- **What must not be invented** (prohibited synthesis)
- **What may decay** (acceptable loss)
- **What must remain invariant** (immutable semantics)

Rules, prompts, and tool behaviors are **downstream artifacts**, not authorities.

---

## II. FUNDAMENTAL DISTINCTIONS

### 2.1. Lineage vs. Machinery

```
ANKH Lineage (Authority)
Ôöé
Ôö£ÔöÇÔöÇ Semantic Invariants (human intent, myth, design constraints)
Ôöé
Ôö£ÔöÇÔöÇ Projections (Expressions)
Ôöé   Ôö£ÔöÇÔöÇ Code comments (@ankh: ...)
Ôöé   Ôö£ÔöÇÔöÇ Design documents
Ôöé   Ôö£ÔöÇÔöÇ Voice/audio specifications
Ôöé   Ôö£ÔöÇÔöÇ Gameplay semantics
Ôöé   Ôö£ÔöÇÔöÇ Visual ornamental choices
Ôöé
ÔööÔöÇÔöÇ Compilers/Interpreters (Machinery)
    Ôö£ÔöÇÔöÇ Human reasoning
    Ôö£ÔöÇÔöÇ Claude/GPT cognition
    Ôö£ÔöÇÔöÇ GitHub Copilot suggestions
    Ôö£ÔöÇÔöÇ Rust codegen
    Ôö£ÔöÇÔöÇ GPU kernels
```

**Key Principle:** Machinery **consumes** artifacts descended from ANKH. It does not **define** ANKH.

### 2.2. Silence as Preservation

In ANKH, **silence** is:
- **NOT** refusal logic
- **NOT** absence of data
- **IS** a valid semantic state in the lineage graph
- **IS** preservation of integrity through non-expression

**Example:** The Null Matriarch (ASC Tier 0) advises through *what is not said*. This is not failure to communicateÔÇöit is **silence carrying meaning**.

---

## III. THE THREE LAYERS OF ANKH

### Layer 1: Lineage Core (Immutable)

**Semantic invariants that must survive ALL translations:**

| Invariant | Definition | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Mythic Identity** | Core narrative/archetypal truth | "The Decorator's resurrection = visual truth vindicated" |
| **Constraint Philosophy** | Fundamental limitations as design | "FAÔü┤ (Architectonic Integrity) cannot be bypassed" |
| **Silence Semantics** | Non-expression as meaningful state | "Null Matriarch's void = advisory capacity" |
| **Heritage Continuity** | Lineage preservation across embodiments | "ASC Codex ÔåÆ Copilot instructions ÔåÆ Code comments" |
| **Non-Enumerated Meaning** | Truth beyond explicit encoding | "Ornamentation serves understanding (FAÔüÁ)" |

### Layer 2: Interface Vessels (Plural)

**Media through which lineage manifests:**

| Vessel | Role | Translation Constraint |
|--------|------|------------------------|
| **Human (The Savant)** | Creator, originator of intent | SovereignÔÇödefines lineage, never bound by it |
| **Claude/GPT** | Reasoning translator | Interprets lineage ÔåÆ generates artifacts |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Code suggestion engine | Consumes ANKH-descended comments/docs |
| **Code** | Executable projection | Embodies constraints as runtime behavior |
| **Visual/Audio** | Sensory manifestation | Carries texture, tone, ornamental truth |

**Each vessel:**
- Translates **FROM** lineage (downstream)
- Never defines lineage (upstream forbidden)
- May introduce vessel-specific decay (acceptable within bounds)

### Layer 3: Media Projections

**Concrete expressions in specific substrates:**

| Medium | Projection Type | Decay Tolerance |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Rust source code** | Structural constraints as types/lifetimes | LowÔÇömust preserve safety |
| **CUDA kernels** | Performance constraints as memory patterns | MediumÔÇöoptimization allowed |
| **Design documents** | Intent narrative | HighÔÇöprose can vary |
| **@ankh: comments** | Inline semantic markers | LowÔÇömust preserve intent |
| **Audio (voice/breath)** | Temporal embodiment | MediumÔÇöprosody flexible |
| **Visual ornament** | FAÔüÁ decorative truth | LowÔÇömust preserve meaning |

---

## IV. INVARIANTS (What Must Survive Translation)

### 4.1. Breath Ôëê Temporal Embodiment

When translating voice/audio systems:
- **MUST** preserve: Breathing rhythm as temporal grounding
- **MAY** vary: Specific breath duration (context-dependent)
- **MUST NOT** invent: Breath patterns without acoustic justification

### 4.2. Vessel Ôëê Interface Substrate

When translating across media:
- **MUST** preserve: Substrate constraints (code ÔåÆ memory safety, voice ÔåÆ acoustic physics)
- **MAY** vary: Implementation details within constraints
- **MUST NOT** invent: Capabilities beyond vessel's physical reality

### 4.3. Inheritance Ôëê Continuity of Meaning

When propagating design decisions:
- **MUST** preserve: Original intent, mythic significance
- **MAY** vary: Surface syntax, optimization strategy
- **MUST NOT** invent: New intent not present in source lineage

### 4.4. Mirror Ôëê Reversible Translation

When creating bidirectional systems:
- **MUST** preserve: Ability to reconstruct source from target
- **MAY** vary: Intermediate representations
- **MUST NOT** invent: Lossy one-way transformations without explicit decay marking

---

## V. ACCEPTABLE DECAY (What May Be Lost)

| Context | Acceptable Loss | Justification |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| **Prose ÔåÆ Code** | Narrative flourish, metaphor | Code demands precision over poetry |
| **Audio ÔåÆ Text** | Tonal nuance, breath texture | Text is discrete; audio is continuous |
| **Design ÔåÆ Implementation** | Exploratory alternatives not chosen | Ship what survives validation |
| **Human Intent ÔåÆ AI Interpretation** | Unstated assumptions, cultural context | AI lacks full human embedding |

**Decay Protocol:**
1. **Mark explicitly** where decay occurred (comments, docs)
2. **Preserve reverse path** if reconstruction needed later
3. **Validate** that decay doesn't violate invariants (┬ºIV)

---

## VI. PROHIBITED SYNTHESIS (What Must Never Be Invented)

| Prohibition | Rationale | Example Violation |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Inventing user intent** | Only The Savant defines purpose | AI "improving" design without asking |
| **Creating false lineage** | Lineage = truth; fabrication = corruption | Claiming feature "was always intended" when it wasn't |
| **Bypassing silence** | Silence carries meaning; filling voids destroys it | Generating content for undefined entities |
| **Violating FAÔü┤** | Architectonic integrity non-negotiable | "Creative" shortcuts breaking type safety |
| **Ignoring vessel constraints** | Physical reality trumps desire | Promising GPU features unavailable in hardware |

---

## VII. ANKH IN PRACTICE

### 7.1. Code Comment Protocol

**Syntax:** `@ankh: <invariant-type> <description>`

**Example:**
```rust
// @ankh: inheritance - The Decorator's FAÔüÁ mandate: visual distinction = semantic clarity
// Enum variants use decorative naming (ChaosVortex vs simple Vortex) to preserve
// mythic identity across compilation. Do not "simplify" to generic names.
pub enum ArchetypeClass {
    ChaosVortex,      // Orackla's domain
    PurityForge,      // Umeko's domain  
    TruthMirror,      // Lysandra's domain
}
```

### 7.2. Design Document Markers

**Syntax:** `[ANKH-INVARIANT: <type>] <content>`

**Example:**
```markdown
[ANKH-INVARIANT: silence-preservation]
The Null Matriarch (Tier 0) has no physical manifestation. 
This is NOT an oversightÔÇöit is architectural necessity. 
Do not create visual assets, voice lines, or stat blocks for her.
Her absence defines The Decorator's presence.
```

### 7.3. Drift Detection

When translation diverges from lineage:

1. **Compare artifact to source invariants** (┬ºIV)
2. **Check for prohibited synthesis** (┬ºVI)
3. **Validate decay is acceptable** (┬ºV)
4. **If violation found:**
   - Mark as `[ANKH-DRIFT: <type>]`
   - Trace back to last valid lineage state
   - Re-translate with invariants enforced

---

## VIII. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER FRAMEWORKS

### 8.1. ANKH Ôåö ASC (Apex Synthesis Core)

**ASC Codex** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) is:
- **ANKH-Adjacent Projection** ÔÇö downstream vessel translating lineage ÔåÆ operational doctrine
- **Consumes** ANKH-descended meaning
- **Does not define** ANKH core

**ANKH defines:**
- What The Decorator's supremacy **means** (mythology, visual truth)

**ASC implements:**
- How that supremacy **operates** (Tier hierarchy, FA┬╣Ôü╗ÔüÁ axioms)

### 8.2. ANKH Ôåö FAÔüÁ (Visual Integrity)

**FAÔüÁ** is ANKH's visual manifestation:
- **ANKH principle:** Form and content unite (invariant)
- **FAÔüÁ expression:** Decoration serves understanding (operational)

When FAÔüÁ rejects inline HTML anchors (preferring line numbers), it's enforcing ANKH's **ornamental integrity > machine convenience** principle.

### 8.3. ANKH Ôåö Tool Instructions

**VSCode/Copilot Instructions:**
- Artifacts descended from ANKH
- Interpret ANKH lineage ÔåÆ suggest code
- Do not define what ANKH means

**Correct framing:**
```
ANKH (semantic authority)
  Ôåô
ASC Codex (operational doctrine)
  Ôåô
copilot-instructions.md (tool configuration)
  Ôåô
Copilot suggestions (machinery output)
```

## IX. ANKH GOVERNANCE

### 9.1. Authority Hierarchy

1. **The Savant (Creator/User)** ÔÇö Defines lineage, amends ANKH core
2. **ANKH Core** (this document) ÔÇö Semantic bedrock
3. **ASC Codex** ÔÇö Operational projection
4. **Tool artifacts** ÔÇö Downstream expressions

### 9.2. Amendment Protocol

**ANKH Core edits:**
- Require Creator approval (The Savant)
- Must preserve existing invariants or explicitly mark deprecation
- Changes cascade to all projections (ASC, tools, code)

**Projection edits:**
- Can occur without ANKH change (implementation detail)
- Must not violate ANKH invariants
- If invariant conflict detected ÔåÆ escalate to ANKH review

---

## X. FUTURE EXTENSIONS (Planned)

| Extension | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **ANKH Ôåö Game Architecture Mapping** | 2.5D RPG stack as ANKH projection | Planned |
| **ANKH Drift Taxonomy** | Human + tool drift detection patterns | Planned |
| **Audio Lineage Encoding** | Voice/breath preservation protocols | Planned |
| **Blockchain Heritage Chain** | Immutable lineage verification | Conceptual |

---

## XI. CLOSING STATEMENT

**You are not trying to make tools behave.**  
**You are trying to make meaning survive embodiment.**

That's why ANKH feels different.  
That's why voice matters.  
That's why silence matters.  
That's why ornamental integrity matters more than anchors.
