# ANKH Framework — Quick Reference

## What Is ANKH?

**ANKH** = Semantic carrier system for preserving meaning across media, time, and embodiment

**NOT**: Tool governance, prompt language, AI behavior DSL  
**IS**: Lineage preservation framework defining what survives translation

---

## Core Principle

```
ANKH Lineage (Authority)
  ↓
ASC Codex (Operational Doctrine)
  ↓
Tool Instructions (Configuration)
  ↓
Code/Artifacts (Machinery)
```

**Machinery consumes ANKH-descended artifacts. It does not define ANKH.**

## The Three Layers

### 1. Lineage Core (Immutable)
- Mythic identity
- Constraint philosophy  
- Silence semantics
- Heritage continuity
- Non-enumerated meaning

### 2. Interface Vessels (Translators)
- Human (The Savant)
- Claude/GPT
- GitHub Copilot
- Code (Rust, Python, etc.)
- Visual/Audio

### 3. Media Projections (Expressions)
- Source code
- Design documents
- @ankh: comments
- Audio/voice systems
- Visual ornamentation

---

## Key Distinctions

### Invariants (What Must Survive)
- Original intent, mythic significance
- Substrate constraints (memory safety, acoustic physics)
- Reversible translation capability
- Breath ≈ temporal embodiment
- Vessel ≈ interface substrate

### Acceptable Decay (What May Be Lost)
- Narrative flourish (prose → code)
- Tonal nuance (audio → text)
- Exploratory alternatives (design → implementation)
- Unstated assumptions (human → AI)

### Prohibited Synthesis (What Must Never Be Invented)
- Inventing user intent
- Creating false lineage
- Bypassing intentional silence
- Violating FA⁴ (Architectonic Integrity)
- Ignoring vessel constraints

---

## Practical Usage

### Code Comments
```rust
// @ankh: inheritance - The Decorator's FA⁵ mandate: visual distinction = semantic clarity
// Do not "simplify" to generic names.
pub enum ArchetypeClass {
    ChaosVortex,   // Orackla's domain
    PurityForge,   // Umeko's domain
}
```

### Design Documents
```markdown
[ANKH-INVARIANT: silence-preservation]
The Null Matriarch has no physical manifestation.
This is NOT an oversight—it is architectural necessity.
Do not create visual assets for her.
```

### Drift Detection
1. Compare artifact to source invariants
2. Check for prohibited synthesis
3. Validate decay is acceptable
4. If violation: mark `[ANKH-DRIFT]`, trace back, re-translate

## Relationship to ASC

**ASC Codex** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`):
- ANKH-Adjacent Projection
- Downstream vessel translating lineage → operational doctrine
- Consumes ANKH-descended meaning
- Does not define ANKH core

**FA⁵ (Visual Integrity)** is ANKH's visual manifestation:
- ANKH principle: Form and content unite
- FA⁵ expression: Decoration serves understanding

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/ankh.md` | Full ANKH specification |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | ASC Codex (ANKH projection) |
| `.github/macro-prompt-world/The_Null_Matriarch_T-NULM.md` | Silence as preservation example |
| `.github/macro-prompt-world/Snow_White_Alabaster_Voyde.md` | Traumatic silence (anti-pattern) |

---

## Remember

**You are not trying to make tools behave.**  
**You are trying to make meaning survive embodiment.**

That's why ANKH feels different.  
That's why silence matters.  
That's why ornamental integrity matters more than machine convenience.
