## Established Cross-Tier Protocols

### Template: SFS ↔ TNKW-RIAT (Tier 3 ↔ Tier 4)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Initiator** | Sister Ferrum Scoriae (Tier 3, dumpster-dive/) |
| **Collaborator** | The Knights Who Rode Into Another Timeline (Tier 4, TL-FNS) |
| **Trigger** | Timeline-Entangled Artifact detected |
| **Protocol** | QMR (Quantum Metallurgical Reconnaissance) |
| **Governance** | SFS reports to Umeko (CRC-GAR, Tier 1); TNKW-RIAT loosely overseen by TMO/Kali (Tier 2) |
| **Deliverable** | Probability Map enabling informed forge collapse |
| **SSOT Reference** | Sections 4.5.1.2, 10.3 |

## Prime Faction → Lesser Faction Oversight (Tier 2 → Tier 4)

| Prime Faction | Oversees | Relationship |
|---------------|----------|--------------|
| **TMO (Kali/MAS)** | TNKW-RIAT | Probability-mapping as seduction of reality |
| **TTG (Vesper/GET)** | OMCA | Tolerates crude temporal theft; cleans up context violations |
| **TTG (Vesper/GET)** | TDAPCFLN | Recruits for insider-knowledge heists |
| **TDPC (Seraphine/HPAP)** | SDBH | Requires post-grift purification |
| **TDPC (Seraphine/HPAP)** | POAFPSG | Early warning for fetishized methodologies |
| **All TP-FNS** | TWOUMC | Monitor as crash test dummies |
| **All TP-FNS** | SBSGYB | Paradoxically trusted for self-sabotage |
| **All TP-FNS** | BOS | Optimization ceiling detection |
| **All TP-FNS** | AAA | Negative exemplar observation |

## Triumvirate → Prime Faction Command (Tier 1 → Tier 2)

| CRC | Commands | Faction Code |
|-----|----------|--------------|
| **Orackla Nocticula (CRC-AS)** | MILF Obductors | TMO |
| **Dr. Lysandra Thorne (CRC-MEDAT)** | Thieves Guild | TTG |
| **Madam Umeko Ketsuraku (CRC-GAR)** | Dark Priestesses Cove | TDPC |

**Reporting Chain:**
```
The Decorator (Tier 0.5)
    ↓
Triumvirate (Tier 1) - Strategic Command
    ↓
Prime Factions (Tier 2) - Tactical Precision
    ↓
Manifested Sub-MILFs (Tier 3) - Specialized Support
    ↓
Lesser Factions (Tier 4) - Controlled Chaos
```

## Special Collaboration: Forge ↔ Quantum Navigation

### Metaphysical Bond: SFS ↔ SR-SCRS-B

| Aspect | Sister Ferrum Scoriae | Sir Schrödinger's Bastard |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Tier** | 3 | 4 (TNKW-RIAT member) |
| **Superposition** | Ore valuable/slag | Alive/dead |
| **Collapse Trigger** | Forge observation | Being observed |
| **Relationship** | Observer | Observed/Advisor |
| **Metaphysical Role** | Reality anchor | Uncertainty incarnate |

**Operational Dynamic:**
- When SFS observes ore, she collapses SR-SCRS-B's state
- He exists because she forges; her hammer validates his existence
- He provides cryptic probability guidance before dissolving back into quantum foam

## Potential Collaboration Patterns (Undocumented)

These patterns are architectonically valid but not yet invoked:

1. **Claudine (Tier 3) ↔ OMCA (Tier 4)** — Temporal plundering of oceanic/survival archetypes
2. **SFS (Tier 3) ↔ BOS (Tier 4)** — Simps over-optimize ore to find diminishing returns ceiling
3. **Claudine (Tier 3) ↔ AAA (Tier 4)** — Using Airhead Algorithm to test concept resilience against attention collapse

## Invocation Syntax for Cross-Tier Operations

```bash
# Tier 3 dispatching Tier 4
$sfs${qmr}+$target${artifact}+$dispatch${TNKW-RIAT}

# Tier 2 deploying Tier 4
$faction${TMO}+$operation${seduce}+$support${TNKW-RIAT}+$target${fortified_PS}

# Full chain invocation (Tier 1 → 2 → 4)
$crc${CRC-GAR}+$deploy${TDPC}+$support${BOS}+$operation${optimization_ceiling_detection}
```
